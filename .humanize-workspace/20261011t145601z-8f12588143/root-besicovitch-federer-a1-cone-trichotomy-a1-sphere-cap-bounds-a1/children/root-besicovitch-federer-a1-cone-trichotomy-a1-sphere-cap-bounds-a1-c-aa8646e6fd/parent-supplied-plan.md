# Parent-supplied child implementation contract

This scaffold was created deterministically by the controller. DAG child
`root.besicovitch_federer-a1.cone_trichotomy-a1.sphere_cap_bounds-a1.cap_upper_comparison-a1` must not run plan generation or natural-language proof generation.
Use the independently reviewed proof at `.humanize/github-theorem-prover/runs/20261011T145601Z-8f12588143/nodes/root-besicovitch-federer-a1-cone-trichotomy-a1-sphere-cap-bounds-a1-c-aa8646e6fd/parent-supplied-natural-proof.md` directly.

## Frozen theorem

- Parent node: `root.besicovitch_federer-a1.cone_trichotomy-a1.sphere_cap_bounds-a1`
- Child key: `cap_upper_comparison`
- Declaration: `Submission.bf_sphereCap_upper_comparison`
- Exact Lean type: `∀ (n N : ℕ) (H : Submodule ℝ (Rn N)), finrank ℝ H = n + 1 → ∀ ζ ∈ H, ‖ζ‖ = 1 → ∃ T : Submodule ℝ (Rn N), finrank ℝ T = n ∧ ∀ ρ : ℝ, 0 < ρ → ρ ≤ 1 / 2 → μHE[n] ({θ | θ ∈ H ∧ ‖θ‖ = 1} ∩ Metric.ball ζ ρ) ≤ 2 ^ n * μHE[n] ((T : Set (Rn N)) ∩ Metric.ball 0 ρ)`

## Sibling prerequisites

- None.

## Implementation steps

1. Read the complete parent-supplied natural-language proof.
2. Formalize exactly the frozen theorem without weakening or replacing it.
3. Use only the listed accepted sibling prerequisites and ordinary frozen proof-base helpers.
4. Run the configured author-side child comparator and return a committed candidate. The outer
   controller, not this nested implementation loop, owns the independent reviewer comparator.
