# Parent-supplied child implementation contract

This scaffold was created deterministically by the controller. DAG child
`root.allard_regularity-a1.tangent_ae-a1` must not run plan generation or natural-language proof generation.
Use the independently reviewed proof at `.humanize/github-theorem-prover/runs/20261011T142321Z-faafe12087/nodes/root-allard-regularity-a1-tangent-ae-a1/parent-supplied-natural-proof.md` directly.

## Frozen theorem

- Parent node: `root.allard_regularity-a1`
- Child key: `tangent_ae`
- Declaration: `Submission.allard52_tangent_ae`
- Exact Lean type: `∀ (n ℓ : ℕ), 1 ≤ n → ∀ (U : Set (Amb n ℓ)), IsOpen U → ∀ V : RectifiableVarifold n ℓ U, AEStronglyMeasurable V.tangentProj V.weight ∧ (∀ᵐ x ∂V.weight, ∃ P : Submodule ℝ (Amb n ℓ), Module.finrank ℝ P = n ∧ V.tangentProj x = P.starProjection) ∧ (∀ᵐ x ∂V.weight, V.HasDensity x (V.mult x))`

## Sibling prerequisites

- None.

## Implementation steps

1. Read the complete parent-supplied natural-language proof.
2. Formalize exactly the frozen theorem without weakening or replacing it.
3. Use only the listed accepted sibling prerequisites and ordinary frozen proof-base helpers.
4. Run the configured author-side child comparator and return a committed candidate. The outer
   controller, not this nested implementation loop, owns the independent reviewer comparator.
