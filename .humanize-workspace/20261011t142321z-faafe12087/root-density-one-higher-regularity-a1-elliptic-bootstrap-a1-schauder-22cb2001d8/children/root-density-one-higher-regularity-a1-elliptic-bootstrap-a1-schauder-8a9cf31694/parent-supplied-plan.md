# Parent-supplied child implementation contract

This scaffold was created deterministically by the controller. DAG child
`root.density_one_higher_regularity-a1.elliptic_bootstrap-a1.schauder_estimate-a1.blowup_estimate-a1.c1_limit-a1` must not run plan generation or natural-language proof generation.
Use the independently reviewed proof at `.humanize/github-theorem-prover/runs/20261011T142321Z-faafe12087/nodes/root-density-one-higher-regularity-a1-elliptic-bootstrap-a1-schauder-8a9cf31694/parent-supplied-natural-proof.md` directly.

## Frozen theorem

- Parent node: `root.density_one_higher_regularity-a1.elliptic_bootstrap-a1.schauder_estimate-a1.blowup_estimate-a1`
- Child key: `c1_limit`
- Declaration: `Submission.dohr_eb_sch_bu_contDiff_of_fderiv_tendsto`
- Exact Lean type: `∀ (n ℓ : ℕ) (W : ℕ → Rn n → Rn ℓ) (V : Rn n → (Rn n →L[ℝ] Rn ℓ)) (R : ℕ → ℝ), Tendsto R atTop atTop → (∀ k, ContDiffOn ℝ 1 (W k) (ball (0 : Rn n) (R k))) → (∀ k, W k 0 = 0) → Continuous V → (∀ r : ℝ, TendstoUniformlyOn (fun k => fderiv ℝ (W k)) V atTop (closedBall (0 : Rn n) r)) → ∃ W' : Rn n → Rn ℓ, ContDiff ℝ 1 W' ∧ ∀ z, fderiv ℝ W' z = V z`

## Sibling prerequisites

- None.

## Implementation steps

1. Read the complete parent-supplied natural-language proof.
2. Formalize exactly the frozen theorem without weakening or replacing it.
3. Use only the listed accepted sibling prerequisites and ordinary frozen proof-base helpers.
4. Run the configured author-side child comparator and return a committed candidate. The outer
   controller, not this nested implementation loop, owns the independent reviewer comparator.
