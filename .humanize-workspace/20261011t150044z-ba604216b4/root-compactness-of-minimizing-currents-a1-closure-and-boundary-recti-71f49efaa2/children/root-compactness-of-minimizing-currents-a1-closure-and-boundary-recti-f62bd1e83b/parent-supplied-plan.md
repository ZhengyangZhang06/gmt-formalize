# Parent-supplied child implementation contract

This scaffold was created deterministically by the controller. DAG child
`root.compactness_of_minimizing_currents-a1.closure_and_boundary_rectifiability-a1.cycle_im-a1.weight_ge_one-a1.bv_estimate-a1.smooth_ae_approx-a1` must not run plan generation or natural-language proof generation.
Use the independently reviewed proof at `.humanize/github-theorem-prover/runs/20261011T150044Z-ba604216b4/nodes/root-compactness-of-minimizing-currents-a1-closure-and-boundary-recti-f62bd1e83b/parent-supplied-natural-proof.md` directly.

## Frozen theorem

- Parent node: `root.compactness_of_minimizing_currents-a1.closure_and_boundary_rectifiability-a1.cycle_im-a1.weight_ge_one-a1.bv_estimate-a1`
- Child key: `smooth_ae_approx`
- Declaration: `Submission.cbr_ci_pw_bv_smooth_ae_approx`
- Exact Lean type: `∀ (n : ℕ) (R δ : ℝ) (g₀ : Euclid n → ℝ), 0 < δ → Measurable g₀ → (∀ x, |g₀ x| ≤ 1) → (∀ x, R ≤ ‖x‖ → g₀ x = 0) → ∃ G : ℕ → Euclid n → ℝ, (∀ j, ContDiff ℝ (⊤ : ℕ∞) (G j)) ∧ (∀ j, HasCompactSupport (G j)) ∧ (∀ j, tsupport (G j) ⊆ ball 0 (R + δ)) ∧ (∀ j x, |G j x| ≤ 1) ∧ ∀ᵐ x ∂(volume : Measure (Euclid n)), Tendsto (fun j => G j x) atTop (𝓝 (g₀ x))`

## Sibling prerequisites

- None.

## Implementation steps

1. Read the complete parent-supplied natural-language proof.
2. Formalize exactly the frozen theorem without weakening or replacing it.
3. Use only the listed accepted sibling prerequisites and ordinary frozen proof-base helpers.
4. Run the configured author-side child comparator and return a committed candidate. The outer
   controller, not this nested implementation loop, owns the independent reviewer comparator.
