# Parent-supplied child implementation contract

This scaffold was created deterministically by the controller. DAG child
`root.compactness_of_minimizing_currents-a1.deformation_theorem-a1.lipschitz_pushforward-a1.operators-a1.slice-a1.covector_bound-a1` must not run plan generation or natural-language proof generation.
Use the independently reviewed proof at `.humanize/github-theorem-prover/runs/20261011T150044Z-ba604216b4/nodes/root-compactness-of-minimizing-currents-a1-deformation-theorem-a1-lip-f92df94753/parent-supplied-natural-proof.md` directly.

## Frozen theorem

- Parent node: `root.compactness_of_minimizing_currents-a1.deformation_theorem-a1.lipschitz_pushforward-a1.operators-a1.slice-a1`
- Child key: `covector_bound`
- Declaration: `Submission.cmcdt_lpo_slice_covector_bound`
- Exact Lean type: `∀ (N k : ℕ) (α : Covector (Euclid N) k) (f : ℝ → Covector (Euclid N) k) (c : ℝ), Continuous f → (∀ v : Fin k → Euclid N, α v = ∫ t in (0 : ℝ)..1, f t v) → (∀ t ∈ Icc (0 : ℝ) 1, covectorEuclideanNorm (f t) ≤ c) → covectorEuclideanNorm α ≤ c`

## Sibling prerequisites

- None.

## Implementation steps

1. Read the complete parent-supplied natural-language proof.
2. Formalize exactly the frozen theorem without weakening or replacing it.
3. Use only the listed accepted sibling prerequisites and ordinary frozen proof-base helpers.
4. Run the configured author-side child comparator and return a committed candidate. The outer
   controller, not this nested implementation loop, owns the independent reviewer comparator.
