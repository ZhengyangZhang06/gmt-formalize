# Parent-supplied child implementation contract

This scaffold was created deterministically by the controller. DAG child
`root.compactness_of_minimizing_currents-a1.deformation_theorem-a1.lipschitz_pushforward-a1.operators-a1.slice-a1.coords-a1` must not run plan generation or natural-language proof generation.
Use the independently reviewed proof at `.humanize/github-theorem-prover/runs/20261011T150044Z-ba604216b4/nodes/root-compactness-of-minimizing-currents-a1-deformation-theorem-a1-lip-e3c28eb395/parent-supplied-natural-proof.md` directly.

## Frozen theorem

- Parent node: `root.compactness_of_minimizing_currents-a1.deformation_theorem-a1.lipschitz_pushforward-a1.operators-a1.slice-a1`
- Child key: `coords`
- Declaration: `Submission.cmcdt_lpo_slice_coords`
- Exact Lean type: `∀ N : ℕ, ∃ L : (ℝ × Euclid N) ≃L[ℝ] Euclid (N + 1), (∀ (t : ℝ) (x : Euclid N), L (t, x) = WithLp.toLp 2 (Fin.cons t (WithLp.ofLp x))) ∧ L (1, 0) = EuclideanSpace.single 0 1 ∧ ∀ x : Euclid N, ‖L (0, x)‖ = ‖x‖`

## Sibling prerequisites

- None.

## Implementation steps

1. Read the complete parent-supplied natural-language proof.
2. Formalize exactly the frozen theorem without weakening or replacing it.
3. Use only the listed accepted sibling prerequisites and ordinary frozen proof-base helpers.
4. Run the configured author-side child comparator and return a committed candidate. The outer
   controller, not this nested implementation loop, owns the independent reviewer comparator.
