# Parent-supplied child implementation contract

This scaffold was created deterministically by the controller. DAG child
`root.density_and_tangent_cones-a1.blowup_compactness-a1.local_comparison-a1.measure_subadditive-a1.open_to_borel-a1` must not run plan generation or natural-language proof generation.
Use the independently reviewed proof at `.humanize/github-theorem-prover/runs/20261011T150044Z-ba604216b4/nodes/root-density-and-tangent-cones-a1-blowup-compactness-a1-local-compari-8bc85f342c/parent-supplied-natural-proof.md` directly.

## Frozen theorem

- Parent node: `root.density_and_tangent_cones-a1.blowup_compactness-a1.local_comparison-a1.measure_subadditive-a1`
- Child key: `open_to_borel`
- Declaration: `Submission.dtc_bc_lc_measure_le_of_le_on_open`
- Exact Lean type: `∀ (P : ℕ) (U : Set (Euclid P)) (μ ν : Measure (Euclid P)), IsOpen U → μ Uᶜ = 0 → (∀ K : Set (Euclid P), IsCompact K → K ⊆ U → ν K < ∞) → (∀ V : Set (Euclid P), IsOpen V → V ⊆ U → μ V ≤ ν V) → μ ≤ ν`

## Sibling prerequisites

- None.

## Implementation steps

1. Read the complete parent-supplied natural-language proof.
2. Formalize exactly the frozen theorem without weakening or replacing it.
3. Use only the listed accepted sibling prerequisites and ordinary frozen proof-base helpers.
4. Run the configured author-side child comparator and return a committed candidate. The outer
   controller, not this nested implementation loop, owns the independent reviewer comparator.
