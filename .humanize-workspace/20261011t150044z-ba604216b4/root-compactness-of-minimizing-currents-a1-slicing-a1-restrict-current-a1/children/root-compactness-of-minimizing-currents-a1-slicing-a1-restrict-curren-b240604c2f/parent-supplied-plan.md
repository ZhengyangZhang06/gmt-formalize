# Parent-supplied child implementation contract

This scaffold was created deterministically by the controller. DAG child
`root.compactness_of_minimizing_currents-a1.slicing-a1.restrict_current-a1.pairing_bound-a1` must not run plan generation or natural-language proof generation.
Use the independently reviewed proof at `.humanize/github-theorem-prover/runs/20261011T150044Z-ba604216b4/nodes/root-compactness-of-minimizing-currents-a1-slicing-a1-restrict-curren-b240604c2f/parent-supplied-natural-proof.md` directly.

## Frozen theorem

- Parent node: `root.compactness_of_minimizing_currents-a1.slicing-a1.restrict_current-a1`
- Child key: `pairing_bound`
- Declaration: `Submission.cmcs_rc_pairing_integrable_abs_le`
- Exact Lean type: `∀ (P n : ℕ) (μ : Measure (Euclid P)) (ξ : Euclid P → MultiVector P n) (E K : Set (Euclid P)) (ω : DifferentialForm (Euclid P) n) (ε : ℝ), AEStronglyMeasurable ξ μ → (∀ᵐ x ∂μ, ∀ α : Covector (Euclid P) n, |ξ x α| ≤ covectorEuclideanNorm α) → Continuous ω → MeasurableSet K → μ K < ∞ → (∀ x, x ∉ K → ω x = 0) → (∀ x, covectorEuclideanNorm (ω x) ≤ ε) → Integrable (fun x => ξ x (ω x)) (μ.restrict E) ∧ |∫ x in E, ξ x (ω x) ∂μ| ≤ ε * (μ K).toReal`

## Sibling prerequisites

- None.

## Implementation steps

1. Read the complete parent-supplied natural-language proof.
2. Formalize exactly the frozen theorem without weakening or replacing it.
3. Use only the listed accepted sibling prerequisites and ordinary frozen proof-base helpers.
4. Run the configured author-side child comparator and return a committed candidate. The outer
   controller, not this nested implementation loop, owns the independent reviewer comparator.
