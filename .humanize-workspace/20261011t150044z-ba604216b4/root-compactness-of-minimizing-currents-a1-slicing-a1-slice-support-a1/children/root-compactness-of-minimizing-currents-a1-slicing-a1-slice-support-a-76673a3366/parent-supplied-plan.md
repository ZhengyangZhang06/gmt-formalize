# Parent-supplied child implementation contract

This scaffold was created deterministically by the controller. DAG child
`root.compactness_of_minimizing_currents-a1.slicing-a1.slice_support-a1.level_split-a1` must not run plan generation or natural-language proof generation.
Use the independently reviewed proof at `.humanize/github-theorem-prover/runs/20261011T150044Z-ba604216b4/nodes/root-compactness-of-minimizing-currents-a1-slicing-a1-slice-support-a-76673a3366/parent-supplied-natural-proof.md` directly.

## Frozen theorem

- Parent node: `root.compactness_of_minimizing_currents-a1.slicing-a1.slice_support-a1`
- Child key: `level_split`
- Declaration: `Submission.cmcs_ss_testForm_level_split`
- Exact Lean type: `∀ (P n : ℕ) (U : Set (Euclid P)) (f : Euclid P → ℝ) (t : ℝ) (η : TestFormOn U n), Continuous f → Disjoint (tsupport (η : DifferentialForm (Euclid P) n)) {x | f x = t} → ∃ η₁ η₂ : TestFormOn U n, η = η₁ + η₂ ∧ tsupport (η₁ : DifferentialForm (Euclid P) n) ⊆ {x | f x < t} ∧ tsupport (η₂ : DifferentialForm (Euclid P) n) ⊆ {x | t < f x}`

## Sibling prerequisites

- None.

## Implementation steps

1. Read the complete parent-supplied natural-language proof.
2. Formalize exactly the frozen theorem without weakening or replacing it.
3. Use only the listed accepted sibling prerequisites and ordinary frozen proof-base helpers.
4. Run the configured author-side child comparator and return a committed candidate. The outer
   controller, not this nested implementation loop, owns the independent reviewer comparator.
