# Parent-supplied child implementation contract

This scaffold was created deterministically by the controller. DAG child
`root.compactness_of_minimizing_currents-a1.local_comparison-a1.mass_triangle-a1` must not run plan generation or natural-language proof generation.
Use the independently reviewed proof at `.humanize/github-theorem-prover/runs/20261011T150044Z-ba604216b4/nodes/root-compactness-of-minimizing-currents-a1-local-comparison-a1-mass-triangle-a1/parent-supplied-natural-proof.md` directly.

## Frozen theorem

- Parent node: `root.compactness_of_minimizing_currents-a1.local_comparison-a1`
- Child key: `mass_triangle`
- Declaration: `Submission.lcmp_massOn_le_add_of_eval_eq`
- Exact Lean type: `∀ (P k : ℕ) (U G : Set (Euclid P)) (X Y Z : GeometricCurrentOn U k) (c : ℝ), |c| ≤ 1 → (∀ ω : TestFormOn U k, tsupport (ω : DifferentialForm (Euclid P) k) ⊆ G → Z ω = X ω + c * Y ω) → Z.massOn G ≤ X.massOn G + Y.massOn G`

## Sibling prerequisites

- None.

## Implementation steps

1. Read the complete parent-supplied natural-language proof.
2. Formalize exactly the frozen theorem without weakening or replacing it.
3. Use only the listed accepted sibling prerequisites and ordinary frozen proof-base helpers.
4. Run the configured author-side child comparator and return a committed candidate. The outer
   controller, not this nested implementation loop, owns the independent reviewer comparator.
