# Parent-supplied child implementation contract

This scaffold was created deterministically by the controller. DAG child
`root.compactness_of_minimizing_currents-a1.slicing-a1.mass_integral-a1` must not run plan generation or natural-language proof generation.
Use the independently reviewed proof at `.humanize/github-theorem-prover/runs/20261011T150044Z-ba604216b4/nodes/root-compactness-of-minimizing-currents-a1-slicing-a1-mass-integral-a1/parent-supplied-natural-proof.md` directly.

## Frozen theorem

- Parent node: `root.compactness_of_minimizing_currents-a1.slicing-a1`
- Child key: `mass_integral`
- Declaration: `Submission.cmcs_slice_mass_integral`
- Exact Lean type: `∀ (P : ℕ) (μ : Measure (Euclid P)) (f : Euclid P → ℝ) (W : Set (Euclid P)) (L : NNReal) (m : ℝ → ℝ≥0∞) (a b : ℝ), Measurable f → MeasurableSet W → (∀ t ∈ Ioo a b, m t ≤ (L : ℝ≥0∞) * liminf (fun h : ℝ => ENNReal.ofReal h⁻¹ * μ (W ∩ {x | t - h < f x ∧ f x < t})) (𝓝[>] 0)) → ∫⁻ t in Ioo a b, m t ≤ (L : ℝ≥0∞) * μ (W ∩ {x | a < f x ∧ f x < b})`

## Sibling prerequisites

- None.

## Implementation steps

1. Read the complete parent-supplied natural-language proof.
2. Formalize exactly the frozen theorem without weakening or replacing it.
3. Use only the listed accepted sibling prerequisites and ordinary frozen proof-base helpers.
4. Run the configured author-side child comparator and return a committed candidate. The outer
   controller, not this nested implementation loop, owns the independent reviewer comparator.
