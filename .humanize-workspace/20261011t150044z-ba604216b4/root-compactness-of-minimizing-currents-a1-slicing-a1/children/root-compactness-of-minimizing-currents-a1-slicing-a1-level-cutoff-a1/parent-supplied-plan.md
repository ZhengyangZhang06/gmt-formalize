# Parent-supplied child implementation contract

This scaffold was created deterministically by the controller. DAG child
`root.compactness_of_minimizing_currents-a1.slicing-a1.level_cutoff-a1` must not run plan generation or natural-language proof generation.
Use the independently reviewed proof at `.humanize/github-theorem-prover/runs/20261011T150044Z-ba604216b4/nodes/root-compactness-of-minimizing-currents-a1-slicing-a1-level-cutoff-a1/parent-supplied-natural-proof.md` directly.

## Frozen theorem

- Parent node: `root.compactness_of_minimizing_currents-a1.slicing-a1`
- Child key: `level_cutoff`
- Declaration: `Submission.cmcs_level_cutoff`
- Exact Lean type: `∀ (P : ℕ) (f : Euclid P → ℝ) (L : NNReal) (t h : ℝ), LipschitzWith L f → 0 < h → h < 1 → ∃ g : Euclid P → ℝ, ContDiff ℝ (⊤ : ℕ∞) g ∧ (∀ x, |g x| ≤ 2) ∧ (∀ x, ‖fderiv ℝ g x‖ ≤ L / (h * (1 - h / 2))) ∧ (∀ x, fderiv ℝ g x ≠ 0 → t - h < f x ∧ f x < t) ∧ (∀ x, f x ≤ t - h → g x = 1) ∧ (∀ x, t ≤ f x → g x = 0)`

## Sibling prerequisites

- `root.compactness_of_minimizing_currents-a1.slicing-a1.lipschitz_smoothing-a1`

## Implementation steps

1. Read the complete parent-supplied natural-language proof.
2. Formalize exactly the frozen theorem without weakening or replacing it.
3. Use only the listed accepted sibling prerequisites and ordinary frozen proof-base helpers.
4. Run the configured author-side child comparator and return a committed candidate. The outer
   controller, not this nested implementation loop, owns the independent reviewer comparator.
