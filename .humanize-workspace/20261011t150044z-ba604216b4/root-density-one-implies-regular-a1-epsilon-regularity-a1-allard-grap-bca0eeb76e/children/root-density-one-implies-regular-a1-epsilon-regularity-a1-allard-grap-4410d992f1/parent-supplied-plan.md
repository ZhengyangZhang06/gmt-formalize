# Parent-supplied child implementation contract

This scaffold was created deterministically by the controller. DAG child
`root.density_one_implies_regular-a1.epsilon_regularity-a1.allard_graph-a1.support_null-a1.density_comparison-a1` must not run plan generation or natural-language proof generation.
Use the independently reviewed proof at `.humanize/github-theorem-prover/runs/20261011T150044Z-ba604216b4/nodes/root-density-one-implies-regular-a1-epsilon-regularity-a1-allard-grap-4410d992f1/parent-supplied-natural-proof.md` directly.

## Frozen theorem

- Parent node: `root.density_one_implies_regular-a1.epsilon_regularity-a1.allard_graph-a1.support_null-a1`
- Child key: `density_comparison`
- Declaration: `Submission.dorag_sn_hausdorff_le_mul_of_lower_density`
- Exact Lean type: `∀ (N n : ℕ) (c : ℝ), 0 < c → ∃ C : ℝ≥0∞, C ≠ ∞ ∧ ∀ (ν : Measure (Euclid N)) (A O : Set (Euclid N)), IsOpen O → A ⊆ O → (∀ x ∈ A, ∃ t₀ : ℝ, 0 < t₀ ∧ ∀ t : ℝ, 0 < t → t < t₀ → ENNReal.ofReal (c * t ^ n) ≤ ν (closedBall x t)) → μHE[n] A ≤ C * ν O`

## Sibling prerequisites

- None.

## Implementation steps

1. Read the complete parent-supplied natural-language proof.
2. Formalize exactly the frozen theorem without weakening or replacing it.
3. Use only the listed accepted sibling prerequisites and ordinary frozen proof-base helpers.
4. Run the configured author-side child comparator and return a committed candidate. The outer
   controller, not this nested implementation loop, owns the independent reviewer comparator.
