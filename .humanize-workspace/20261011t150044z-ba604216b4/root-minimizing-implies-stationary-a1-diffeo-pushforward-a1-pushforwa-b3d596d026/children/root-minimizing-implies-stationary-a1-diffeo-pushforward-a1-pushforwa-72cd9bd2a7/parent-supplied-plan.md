# Parent-supplied child implementation contract

This scaffold was created deterministically by the controller. DAG child
`root.minimizing_implies_stationary-a1.diffeo_pushforward-a1.pushforward_boundary-a1.smooth_pullback_test_form-a1` must not run plan generation or natural-language proof generation.
Use the independently reviewed proof at `.humanize/github-theorem-prover/runs/20261011T150044Z-ba604216b4/nodes/root-minimizing-implies-stationary-a1-diffeo-pushforward-a1-pushforwa-72cd9bd2a7/parent-supplied-natural-proof.md` directly.

## Frozen theorem

- Parent node: `root.minimizing_implies_stationary-a1.diffeo_pushforward-a1.pushforward_boundary-a1`
- Child key: `smooth_pullback_test_form`
- Declaration: `Submission.dpf_pb_smooth_pullback_isTestForm`
- Exact Lean type: `∀ (P d : ℕ) (K' : Set (Euclid P)) (ψ : Euclid P → Euclid P) (α : DifferentialForm (Euclid P) d), IsCompact K' → ContDiff ℝ (⊤ : ℕ∞) ψ → (∀ x, x ∉ K' → ψ x = x) → IsTestForm α → IsTestForm (fun x => (α (ψ x)).compContinuousLinearMap (fderiv ℝ ψ x)) ∧ tsupport (fun x => (α (ψ x)).compContinuousLinearMap (fderiv ℝ ψ x)) ⊆ tsupport α ∪ K'`

## Sibling prerequisites

- None.

## Implementation steps

1. Read the complete parent-supplied natural-language proof.
2. Formalize exactly the frozen theorem without weakening or replacing it.
3. Use only the listed accepted sibling prerequisites and ordinary frozen proof-base helpers.
4. Run the configured author-side child comparator and return a committed candidate. The outer
   controller, not this nested implementation loop, owns the independent reviewer comparator.
