# Parent-supplied child implementation contract

This scaffold was created deterministically by the controller. DAG child
`root.slicing-a1.mass_representation-a1.unit_form_density-a1.integral_lower_bound-a1` must not run plan generation or natural-language proof generation.
Use the independently reviewed proof at `.humanize/github-theorem-prover/runs/20261011T144224Z-6e4735dbca/nodes/root-slicing-a1-mass-representation-a1-unit-form-density-a1-integral-9d081869a2/parent-supplied-natural-proof.md` directly.

## Frozen theorem

- Parent node: `root.slicing-a1.mass_representation-a1.unit_form_density-a1`
- Child key: `integral_lower_bound`
- Declaration: `Submission.smr_ufd_integral_lower_bound`
- Exact Lean type: `∀ (P : ℕ) (μ : Measure (Eucl P)) (g : Eucl P → ℝ) (A C S : Set (Eucl P)) (c : ℝ≥0∞), MeasurableSet A → MeasurableSet C → MeasurableSet S → C ⊆ A → μ S < ∞ → Measurable g → (∀ x, |g x| ≤ 1) → (∀ x ∈ C, g x = 1) → (∀ x, x ∉ S → g x = 0) → c + μ (S \ C) < μ C → c < ENNReal.ofReal (∫ x in A, g x ∂μ)`

## Sibling prerequisites

- None.

## Implementation steps

1. Read the complete parent-supplied natural-language proof.
2. Formalize exactly the frozen theorem without weakening or replacing it.
3. Use only the listed accepted sibling prerequisites and ordinary frozen proof-base helpers.
4. Run the configured author-side child comparator and return a committed candidate. The outer
   controller, not this nested implementation loop, owns the independent reviewer comparator.
