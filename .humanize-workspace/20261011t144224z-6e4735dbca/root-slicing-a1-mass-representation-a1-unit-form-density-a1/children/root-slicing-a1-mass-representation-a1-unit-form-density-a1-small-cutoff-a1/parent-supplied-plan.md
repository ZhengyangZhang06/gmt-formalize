# Parent-supplied child implementation contract

This scaffold was created deterministically by the controller. DAG child
`root.slicing-a1.mass_representation-a1.unit_form_density-a1.small_cutoff-a1` must not run plan generation or natural-language proof generation.
Use the independently reviewed proof at `.humanize/github-theorem-prover/runs/20261011T144224Z-6e4735dbca/nodes/root-slicing-a1-mass-representation-a1-unit-form-density-a1-small-cutoff-a1/parent-supplied-natural-proof.md` directly.

## Frozen theorem

- Parent node: `root.slicing-a1.mass_representation-a1.unit_form_density-a1`
- Child key: `small_cutoff`
- Declaration: `Submission.smr_ufd_small_cutoff`
- Exact Lean type: `∀ (P : ℕ) (U : Set (Eucl P)) (μ : Measure (Eucl P)), (∀ K : Set (Eucl P), IsCompact K → K ⊆ U → μ K < ∞) → ∀ C W : Set (Eucl P), IsCompact C → IsOpen W → C ⊆ W → W ⊆ U → ∀ ε : ℝ≥0∞, ε ≠ 0 → ∃ ψ : Eucl P → ℝ, Continuous ψ ∧ HasCompactSupport ψ ∧ tsupport ψ ⊆ W ∧ (∀ x, 0 ≤ ψ x ∧ ψ x ≤ 1) ∧ (∀ x ∈ C, ψ x = 1) ∧ μ (Function.support ψ \ C) < ε`

## Sibling prerequisites

- None.

## Implementation steps

1. Read the complete parent-supplied natural-language proof.
2. Formalize exactly the frozen theorem without weakening or replacing it.
3. Use only the listed accepted sibling prerequisites and ordinary frozen proof-base helpers.
4. Run the configured author-side child comparator and return a committed candidate. The outer
   controller, not this nested implementation loop, owns the independent reviewer comparator.
