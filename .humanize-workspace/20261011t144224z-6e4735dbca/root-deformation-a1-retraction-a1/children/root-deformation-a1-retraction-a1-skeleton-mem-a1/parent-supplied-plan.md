# Parent-supplied child implementation contract

This scaffold was created deterministically by the controller. DAG child
`root.deformation-a1.retraction-a1.skeleton_mem-a1` must not run plan generation or natural-language proof generation.
Use the independently reviewed proof at `.humanize/github-theorem-prover/runs/20261011T144224Z-6e4735dbca/nodes/root-deformation-a1-retraction-a1-skeleton-mem-a1/parent-supplied-natural-proof.md` directly.

## Frozen theorem

- Parent node: `root.deformation-a1.retraction-a1`
- Child key: `skeleton_mem`
- Declaration: `Submission.deformation_retraction_skeleton_mem`
- Exact Lean type: `∀ (m ℓ : ℕ) (x : Eucl (m + 1 + ℓ)), (∃ I : Finset (Fin (m + 1 + ℓ)), I.card = ℓ ∧ ∀ i ∈ I, ∃ k : ℤ, x i = k) → x ∈ ⋃ F : LatticeFaceIndex (m + 1) (m + 1 + ℓ), latticeFace 1 F`

## Sibling prerequisites

- None.

## Implementation steps

1. Read the complete parent-supplied natural-language proof.
2. Formalize exactly the frozen theorem without weakening or replacing it.
3. Use only the listed accepted sibling prerequisites and ordinary frozen proof-base helpers.
4. Run the configured author-side child comparator and return a committed candidate. The outer
   controller, not this nested implementation loop, owns the independent reviewer comparator.
