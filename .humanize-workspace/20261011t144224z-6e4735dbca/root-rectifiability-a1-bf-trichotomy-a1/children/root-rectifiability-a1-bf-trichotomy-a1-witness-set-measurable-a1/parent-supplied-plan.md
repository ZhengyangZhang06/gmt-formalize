# Parent-supplied child implementation contract

This scaffold was created deterministically by the controller. DAG child
`root.rectifiability-a1.bf_trichotomy-a1.witness_set_measurable-a1` must not run plan generation or natural-language proof generation.
Use the independently reviewed proof at `.humanize/github-theorem-prover/runs/20261011T144224Z-6e4735dbca/nodes/root-rectifiability-a1-bf-trichotomy-a1-witness-set-measurable-a1/parent-supplied-natural-proof.md` directly.

## Frozen theorem

- Parent node: `root.rectifiability-a1.bf_trichotomy-a1`
- Child key: `witness_set_measurable`
- Declaration: `Submission.rectifiability_bf_witness_set_measurable`
- Exact Lean type: `∀ (N m : ℕ) (E : Set (Eucl N)) (δ : ℝ), IsSigmaCompact E → MeasurableSet {p : Eucl N × (Fin (m + 1) → Eucl N) | ∃ x ∈ E, x ≠ p.1 ∧ dist x p.1 < δ ∧ (WithLp.toLp 2 (fun i : Fin (m + 1) => inner ℝ (p.2 i) x) : Eucl (m + 1)) = (WithLp.toLp 2 (fun i : Fin (m + 1) => inner ℝ (p.2 i) p.1) : Eucl (m + 1))}`

## Sibling prerequisites

- None.

## Implementation steps

1. Read the complete parent-supplied natural-language proof.
2. Formalize exactly the frozen theorem without weakening or replacing it.
3. Use only the listed accepted sibling prerequisites and ordinary frozen proof-base helpers.
4. Run the configured author-side child comparator and return a committed candidate. The outer
   controller, not this nested implementation loop, owns the independent reviewer comparator.
