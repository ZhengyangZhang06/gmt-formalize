# Parent-supplied child implementation contract

This scaffold was created deterministically by the controller. DAG child
`root.lipschitz_pushforward_im-a1.weighted_tangent_on_c1_chart-a1.blowup_change_of_variables-a1` must not run plan generation or natural-language proof generation.
Use the independently reviewed proof at `.humanize/github-theorem-prover/runs/20261011T144224Z-6e4735dbca/nodes/root-lipschitz-pushforward-im-a1-weighted-tangent-on-c1-chart-a1-blow-7c8d1035a6/parent-supplied-natural-proof.md` directly.

## Frozen theorem

- Parent node: `root.lipschitz_pushforward_im-a1.weighted_tangent_on_c1_chart-a1`
- Child key: `blowup_change_of_variables`
- Declaration: `Submission.lpf_wtc_blowup_setIntegral_image`
- Exact Lean type: `∀ (Q n : ℕ) (y : Eucl Q) (r : ℝ) (S : Set (Eucl Q)) (g : Eucl Q → ℝ), 0 < r → ∫ z in Poincare.SimonGMT.Chapter03.blowUpMap y r '' S, g z ∂(μHE[n] : Measure (Eucl Q)) = (r ^ n)⁻¹ * ∫ x in S, g (Poincare.SimonGMT.Chapter03.blowUpMap y r x) ∂(μHE[n] : Measure (Eucl Q))`

## Sibling prerequisites

- None.

## Implementation steps

1. Read the complete parent-supplied natural-language proof.
2. Formalize exactly the frozen theorem without weakening or replacing it.
3. Use only the listed accepted sibling prerequisites and ordinary frozen proof-base helpers.
4. Run the configured author-side child comparator and return a committed candidate. The outer
   controller, not this nested implementation loop, owns the independent reviewer comparator.
