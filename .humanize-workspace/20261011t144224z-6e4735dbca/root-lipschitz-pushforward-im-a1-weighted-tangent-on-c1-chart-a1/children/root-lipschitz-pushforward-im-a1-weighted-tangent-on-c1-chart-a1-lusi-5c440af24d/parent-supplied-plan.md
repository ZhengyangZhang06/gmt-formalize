# Parent-supplied child implementation contract

This scaffold was created deterministically by the controller. DAG child
`root.lipschitz_pushforward_im-a1.weighted_tangent_on_c1_chart-a1.lusin_compact_pieces-a1` must not run plan generation or natural-language proof generation.
Use the independently reviewed proof at `.humanize/github-theorem-prover/runs/20261011T144224Z-6e4735dbca/nodes/root-lipschitz-pushforward-im-a1-weighted-tangent-on-c1-chart-a1-lusi-5c440af24d/parent-supplied-natural-proof.md` directly.

## Frozen theorem

- Parent node: `root.lipschitz_pushforward_im-a1.weighted_tangent_on_c1_chart-a1`
- Child key: `lusin_compact_pieces`
- Declaration: `Submission.lpf_wtc_lusin_compact_pieces`
- Exact Lean type: `∀ (Q n : ℕ) (V M : Set (Eucl Q)) (θ : Eucl Q → ℝ), IsOpen V → M ⊆ V → NullMeasurableSet M (μHE[n] : Measure (Eucl Q)) → (∀ y ∈ M, 0 < θ y) → (∀ K : Set (Eucl Q), IsCompact K → K ⊆ V → IntegrableOn θ (M ∩ K) (μHE[n] : Measure (Eucl Q))) → ∃ C : ℕ → Set (Eucl Q), (∀ k, IsCompact (C k)) ∧ (∀ k, C k ⊆ M) ∧ (∀ k, ContinuousOn θ (C k)) ∧ (∀ k, (μHE[n] : Measure (Eucl Q)) (C k) < ∞) ∧ (μHE[n] : Measure (Eucl Q)) (M \ ⋃ k, C k) = 0`

## Sibling prerequisites

- None.

## Implementation steps

1. Read the complete parent-supplied natural-language proof.
2. Formalize exactly the frozen theorem without weakening or replacing it.
3. Use only the listed accepted sibling prerequisites and ordinary frozen proof-base helpers.
4. Run the configured author-side child comparator and return a committed candidate. The outer
   controller, not this nested implementation loop, owns the independent reviewer comparator.
