# Parent-supplied child implementation contract

This scaffold was created deterministically by the controller. DAG child
`root.allard_tangent_cones-a1.flat_blowup_ball_limits-a1.filter_squeeze-a1` must not run plan generation or natural-language proof generation.
Use the independently reviewed proof at `.humanize/github-theorem-prover/runs/20261011T141839Z-af4f31741f/nodes/root-allard-tangent-cones-a1-flat-blowup-ball-limits-a1-filter-squeeze-a1/parent-supplied-natural-proof.md` directly.

## Frozen theorem

- Parent node: `root.allard_tangent_cones-a1.flat_blowup_ball_limits-a1`
- Child key: `filter_squeeze`
- Declaration: `Submission.allard_tc_fbl_squeeze`
- Exact Lean type: `∀ {ι : Type} (l : Filter ι) (m : ι → ℝ) (a b : ℕ → ι → ℝ) (A B : ℕ → ℝ) (L : ℝ), (∀ k, ∀ᶠ i in l, a k i ≤ m i ∧ m i ≤ b k i) → (∀ k, Tendsto (a k) l (𝓝 (A k))) → (∀ k, Tendsto (b k) l (𝓝 (B k))) → Tendsto A atTop (𝓝 L) → Tendsto B atTop (𝓝 L) → Tendsto m l (𝓝 L)`

## Sibling prerequisites

- None.

## Implementation steps

1. Read the complete parent-supplied natural-language proof.
2. Formalize exactly the frozen theorem without weakening or replacing it.
3. Use only the listed accepted sibling prerequisites and ordinary frozen proof-base helpers.
4. Run the configured author-side child comparator and return a committed candidate. The outer
   controller, not this nested implementation loop, owns the independent reviewer comparator.
