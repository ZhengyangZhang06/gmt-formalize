# Parent-supplied child implementation contract

This scaffold was created deterministically by the controller. DAG child
`root.monotonicity_density-a1.monotonicity_formula-a1.radial_layer_cake-a1` must not run plan generation or natural-language proof generation.
Use the independently reviewed proof at `.humanize/github-theorem-prover/runs/20261011T141839Z-af4f31741f/nodes/root-monotonicity-density-a1-monotonicity-formula-a1-radial-layer-cake-a1/parent-supplied-natural-proof.md` directly.

## Frozen theorem

- Parent node: `root.monotonicity_density-a1.monotonicity_formula-a1`
- Child key: `radial_layer_cake`
- Declaration: `Submission.mono833_radial_layer_cake_le`
- Exact Lean type: `∀ (N : ℕ) (ν μ : Measure (Euclidean N)) (x : Euclidean N) (ρ₀ Λ A t : ℝ) (φ : ℝ → ℝ), (∀ r : ℝ, 0 < r → r < ρ₀ → ν (closedBall x r) ≤ ENNReal.ofReal Λ * μ (closedBall x r)) → Continuous φ → Antitone φ → (∀ s : ℝ, s ≤ 1 → φ s = 1) → (∀ s : ℝ, A ^ 2 ≤ s → φ s = 0) → 0 < A → 0 < t → t * A < ρ₀ → ∫⁻ y, ENNReal.ofReal (φ (‖y - x‖ ^ 2 / t ^ 2)) ∂ν ≤ ENNReal.ofReal Λ * ∫⁻ y, ENNReal.ofReal (φ (‖y - x‖ ^ 2 / t ^ 2)) ∂μ`

## Sibling prerequisites

- None.

## Implementation steps

1. Read the complete parent-supplied natural-language proof.
2. Formalize exactly the frozen theorem without weakening or replacing it.
3. Use only the listed accepted sibling prerequisites and ordinary frozen proof-base helpers.
4. Run the configured author-side child comparator and return a committed candidate. The outer
   controller, not this nested implementation loop, owns the independent reviewer comparator.
