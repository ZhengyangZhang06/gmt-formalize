# Parent-supplied child implementation contract

This scaffold was created deterministically by the controller. DAG child
`root.bv_results-a1.mollifier_gradient-a1.smooth_duality_compact-a1.eta_limit-a1` must not run plan generation or natural-language proof generation.
Use the independently reviewed proof at `.humanize/github-theorem-prover/runs/20261011T141923Z-ed98166de3/nodes/root-bv-results-a1-mollifier-gradient-a1-smooth-duality-compact-a1-eta-limit-a1/parent-supplied-natural-proof.md` directly.

## Frozen theorem

- Parent node: `root.bv_results-a1.mollifier_gradient-a1.smooth_duality_compact-a1`
- Child key: `eta_limit`
- Declaration: `Submission.bv_set_lintegral_le_of_regularized_bound`
- Exact Lean type: `∀ (n : ℕ) (f χ : Rn n → ℝ) (L : Set (Rn n)) (M : ℝ≥0∞), Continuous f → (∀ x, 0 ≤ f x) → Continuous χ → HasCompactSupport χ → (∀ x, 0 ≤ χ x) → IsCompact L → (∀ x ∈ L, χ x = 1) → (∀ η : ℝ, 0 < η → ENNReal.ofReal (∫ x, χ x * f x ^ 2 / Real.sqrt (f x ^ 2 + η ^ 2)) ≤ M) → ∫⁻ x in L, ENNReal.ofReal (f x) ≤ M`

## Sibling prerequisites

- None.

## Implementation steps

1. Read the complete parent-supplied natural-language proof.
2. Formalize exactly the frozen theorem without weakening or replacing it.
3. Use only the listed accepted sibling prerequisites and ordinary frozen proof-base helpers.
4. Run the configured author-side child comparator and return a committed candidate. The outer
   controller, not this nested implementation loop, owns the independent reviewer comparator.
