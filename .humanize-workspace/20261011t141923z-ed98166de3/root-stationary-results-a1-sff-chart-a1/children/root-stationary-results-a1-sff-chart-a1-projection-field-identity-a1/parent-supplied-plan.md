# Parent-supplied child implementation contract

This scaffold was created deterministically by the controller. DAG child
`root.stationary_results-a1.sff_chart-a1.projection_field_identity-a1` must not run plan generation or natural-language proof generation.
Use the independently reviewed proof at `.humanize/github-theorem-prover/runs/20261011T141923Z-ed98166de3/nodes/root-stationary-results-a1-sff-chart-a1-projection-field-identity-a1/parent-supplied-natural-proof.md` directly.

## Frozen theorem

- Parent node: `root.stationary_results-a1.sff_chart-a1`
- Child key: `projection_field_identity`
- Declaration: `Submission.sff_projection_field_fderiv_identity`
- Exact Lean type: `∀ (n N : ℕ) (ψ : Rn n → Rn N) (Q : Rn N → (Rn N →L[ℝ] Rn N)) (x₀ : Rn n), DifferentiableAt ℝ ψ x₀ → DifferentiableAt ℝ (fderiv ℝ ψ) x₀ → DifferentiableAt ℝ Q (ψ x₀) → (∀ᶠ x in 𝓝 x₀, ∀ v : Rn n, Q (ψ x) (fderiv ℝ ψ x v) = fderiv ℝ ψ x v) → ∀ a b : Rn n, fderiv ℝ Q (ψ x₀) (fderiv ℝ ψ x₀ a) (fderiv ℝ ψ x₀ b) = fderiv ℝ (fderiv ℝ ψ) x₀ a b - Q (ψ x₀) (fderiv ℝ (fderiv ℝ ψ) x₀ a b)`

## Sibling prerequisites

- None.

## Implementation steps

1. Read the complete parent-supplied natural-language proof.
2. Formalize exactly the frozen theorem without weakening or replacing it.
3. Use only the listed accepted sibling prerequisites and ordinary frozen proof-base helpers.
4. Run the configured author-side child comparator and return a committed candidate. The outer
   controller, not this nested implementation loop, owns the independent reviewer comparator.
